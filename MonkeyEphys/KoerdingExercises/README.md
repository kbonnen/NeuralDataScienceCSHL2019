The first part of the lecture will use the matlab tutorials in this file:

1) NeuralDecoding.m  (solutions in NeuralDecodingSOL.m)
2) TutorialCSHLSteinmetz.m

The second part of the lecture will rely on a jupyter notebook in colaboratory:

https://github.com/KordingLab/Neural_Decoding/blob/classifiers/central_concepts_in_ML_for_decoding.ipynb 

(files in the github to be opened in Colab: there is a link at the top of the github repository)
