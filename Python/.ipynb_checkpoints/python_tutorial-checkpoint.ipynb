    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with python, install Anaconda [python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). This will come with many useful libraries for data analysis. Now if you're in **Windows**, open up an \"Anaconda prompt\" and you're good to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're in **Linux** you'll want to make sure that your `~/.bashrc` profile points to Anaconda python, not the built in python (so when you open a terminal you're all set). Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` file if it's not there already (where `<user>` is your username):\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "export PATH=\"/home/<user>/anaconda3/bin:$PATH\"\n",
    "conda activate\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're in **Mac**, here are detailed [instructions](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-anaconda-mac-os-x). It should work out of the box in a terminal, but if not you may need to modify your `.bash_profile` like in Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Packages and environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda has a package manager [**conda**](https://conda.io/en/latest/) that you can use to install packages. Here is a good [tutorial](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) if you want more info. To install a package say\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "conda install numpy\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "To upgrade to the latest version of a package say\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "conda install numpy --upgrade\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Another package manager is `pip`, these are packages that are written only in python (see info [here](https://www.anaconda.com/understanding-conda-and-pip/)). Generally these will be packages that you find on github. I recommend using `conda` when available (e.g. for things like numpy or scikit-learn) because it makes sure that all dependencies are working. Dependencies are packages on which a package depends - most packages in data analysis will depend on the core packages like numpy and scipy.\n",
    "\n",
    "conda also allows you to create different **environments** for your code. This is different from matlab. In python, there are many packages with different versions that aren't always backward compatible. Therefore, you may write code that might not work quite the same way in a year or so with the latest packages. However, all python packages have **version** control, so you can specifically install an older package with\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "pip install suite2p==0.5.5\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "or\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "conda install numpy==1.13.0\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "You may therefore want different environments for different code packages. To create and activate an environment, you can say\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "conda create -n cshl\n",
    "conda activate cshl\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you're in a new environment, you should see `(cshl)` on the left-hand side of your terminal. You can install packages here as you wish, and your `(base)` anaconda packages won't change. To see what packages are installed you can say\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "conda list\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "To close the environment, say\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Many packages that you might install from github come with `environment.yml` files to make an environment with the correct dependencies for you. Once in a folder which contains the `environment.yml`, run the following to create the environment:\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "The name of the environment will be in the .yml file, and conda will tell you it after it finishes creating it so you can then activate it.\n",
