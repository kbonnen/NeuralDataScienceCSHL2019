%the idea is that all parameters that guide how the code we write is modified,
%should go here). Stuff like: Which baseline to use, how much pre-stimulus
%time, choices about the analysis you make that changes the entire
%analysis. Important: Put *all* of them here, at the beginning of the
%program, so you can modify them all here. You don't miss any hidden
%variable.

set(0,'DefaultFigureWindowStyle','docked'); %Makes figures docked. Better for teaching

%Guiding idea: Everything that modifies how the script works is in one
%place, at the very beginning. This makes the code maintainable.
